# hall-solver
Poisson solver for the Hall effect in two dimensions using finite differences method

Package is based on Poisson-solver-2D by Mohammad Asif Zaman
https://github.com/zaman13/Poisson-solver-2D

This code is used for the publication
"Measured potential profile in a quantum anomalous Hall system 
suggests bulk-dominated current flow" by Ilan T. Rosen et al.,
available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13123.

The datasets, simulations, and data analysis for which this code was
originally written are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5826196.
